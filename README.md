# mgga-postanalysis
Script to slope-correct values of CH4 and CO2 measured via MGGA. Gas concentration is measured via injection loop and MGGA; either low change from baseline (~15ppb) or too low in general (&lt; atmospheric levels, eqeal to &lt; 1.9ppm) needs to be slope-corrected. Samples processed in parallel. Input files: sample-period-times.csv, mgga-time-ch4-co2.csv.
