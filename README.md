# mgga-postanalysis
R code to slope-correct values of CH4 and CO2 measured via MGGA. The gas concentration is measured via injection loop attached to MGGA; either low change from baseline (~15ppb) or too low in general (&lt; atmospheric levels, equal to &lt; 1.9ppm) needs to be slope-corrected. 
Samples are processed in parallel. 
Input files: sample-period-times.csv, mgga-time-ch4-co2.csv.
